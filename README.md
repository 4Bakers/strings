VRChat's String Dowloader requires me to host them SOMEWHERE, so they're here.
There is no code, this repository is literally just TXT files containing usernames.

There are lists hosted in other repos for the sake of simpler updating and management, which will be listed here assuming I remember to
- [grillbysemployees.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Toow5/Toow5/main/grillbysemployees.txt)

My personal Gists
- [admin](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/4Bakers/2ee467da39996e41f15340f3f7f003af/raw/admin.txt)

Being deprecated in favor of GitHub Gists due to VRChat limitations for "safe URLs"
